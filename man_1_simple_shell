DESCRIPTION

       The shell can execute external commands and built-in commands.

       External commands are executed by providing the command name and any
       required arguments.

       Built-in commands are internal to the shell and include:

       exit - Exit the shell.

       /usr/bin/
       /bin/
       /usr/local/games/
       /usr/games/

       If a command is not found in these directories, an error is displayed.
