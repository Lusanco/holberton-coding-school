# Holberton Coding School Learning Archive

A curated collection of assignments, tasks, and projects from my time at Holberton Coding School, designed for review and self-assessment.

## Summary:

This repository serves as an archive and it covers a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including:

- *Shell Scripting:* Bash and Linux Commands
- *Systems Programming*: C
- *General-Purpose Programming*: Python
- *Web Development*: HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Flask
- *Database Management*: SQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy

## Purpose:

The primary purpose of this archive is to serve as a reference point for reviewing and re-learning key concepts from my Holberton experience. By organizing and categorizing my work, I can easily revisit specific topics and identify areas for further study or improvement.

## Organization:

This repository is organized into subdirectories based on the primary programming language or technology used in each project. For example, projects related to web development might be grouped under a "Web" directory, while those involving database management would be placed in a "Database" directory.

## Note:

This archive (currently) is a **work in progress**, and I may continue to add or update projects as I revisit my learning materials.
