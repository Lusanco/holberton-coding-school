## Description

This is our submission project for *Holberton Coding School's* module of *C - Binary Trees*. In this module we worked and learned about what is a *binary tree*, what is the difference between a *Binary tree* and a *Binary Search Tree*, what is the possible gain in terms of *time complexity* compared to *linked lists*, what are the *depth*, the *height*, the *size* of a binary tree, what are the different *traversal methods* to go through a binary tree and what is a *complete*, a *full*, a *perfect* and a *balanced* binary tree.
