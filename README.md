# Holberton Coding School Learning Archive

A curated collection of assignments, tasks, and projects from my time at Holberton Coding School, designed for review and self-assessment.

## Summary:

This repository serves as an archive and it covers a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including:

- **Shell Scripting:** Bash and Linux Commands
- **Systems Programming**: C
- **General-Purpose Programming**: Python
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Flask
- **Database Management**: SQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy

## Purpose:

The primary purpose of this archive is to serve as a reference point for reviewing and re-learning key concepts from my Holberton experience. By organizing and categorizing my work, I can easily revisit specific topics and identify areas for further study or improvement.

## Organization:

This repository is currently organized into a single "repos" directory, containing all projects as-is, similar to the original Holberton structure. I plan to reorganize the projects into subdirectories based on programming languages, concepts, or topics to improve navigation and accessibility.

## Note:

This archive (currently) is a **work in progress**, and I may continue to add or update projects as I revisit my learning materials.
